1. Try to make the two handlers update the view in a similar way <- inheritance
2. make classes import each other less
3. for items, if rooms, characters, and player could hold Item objects instead of strings, that would be nice <- top priority?
4. convert things in classes that hold json info to a big dict
5. make save system
6. crit system or something. something to make armor not always effective at blocking damage completely
7. clean up the action handler. take input, parse it, then let the other class handle what happens
8. allow multiples of items
9. better fight graphics, who's attack is missing
10. format view character page to accomnodate longer item names
11. make some items untakable i.e. they belong to a room (water fountain)
12. give items action descriptors (eg "The water quenches your thirst", "You swing the katana like a pro" (this means NPC weapons will need to be actual items.))
13. Maybe a calculator that sets enemy stats based on player level
14. what happens if player gets enough experience to skip a level
15. give items alternate descriptors like characters have
16. ressurect the rpg class to handle large chunks of text
17. put inital player stats in JSON
