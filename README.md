This is the beta version of a text adventure game I am making. You run it with Python 3.7. No extra modules are needed.

You can make your own adventure by modifying the JSON files. Right now all fields must be left in place, but you don't have to give them a value.

The code is a mess right now. Next on the agenda is refactoring.
