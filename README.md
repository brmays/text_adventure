Text Adventure is a text based adventure game. The code is a mess right now. Refactoring is next on my list. 

The included JSONs contain all the content needed for a short adventure. You can make your own adventure by editing the JSONs, but the current structure must remain intact.

Text Adventure has been tested with python 3.9 and python 3.10. No additional modules are needed. Just run game_main.py with python.
